I would go with a cross-platform application. This allows users to be able to see community events on the fly from their mobile devices I would use either microservices software design architecture because of the different products/services the user will need to access. This allows individual parts to be updates/changed/fixed if necessary without impacting the entire application. I would use the MERN stack so I can use React/React Native to build the cross-platform application.
