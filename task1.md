Benefits of Client-Server Architecture
1. Scalability by adding more servers, the number of clients can increase and rthey can all be serviced and not experience lag or slow speeds from the server side. This is done by adding more servers and load balancers. This can also be done without disruptions.

2. Security by the data being stored in the centralized server allows for it to be guarded and proper access management. Data can be backed up and restored here as well.

Drawbacks of Client-Server Architecture

1. Server cost, servers are expensive to set up and maintain. Its also hard to difficult to repair and will result in downtime if they go down.
